# Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and UTAUT

## Overview

TAM posits that Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) determine behavioral intention to use technology. UTAUT synthesizes eight prior models into four core constructs — Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions — moderated by age, gender, experience, and voluntariness.

## When to Use

- Predicting user adoption of a new technology or system
- Diagnosing why a technology rollout has low uptake
- Designing interventions to improve acceptance rates
- Comparing adoption drivers across user segments

## When NOT to Use

- Post-adoption continuance (use Expectation-Confirmation Model)
- Organizational-level diffusion (use DOI or TOE framework)
- When adoption is mandatory with no behavioral variance

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Technology adoption is driven by PERCEIVED value, not actual
capability. A superior system with poor perceived usefulness will be
rejected; an inferior system perceived as useful will be adopted.
```

Key assumptions:
1. Users are rational actors who form intentions before behavior
2. Perceptions can be measured via self-report instruments
3. External variables influence adoption only through the core constructs
4. Behavioral intention is the primary predictor of actual use

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Define the technology and user population

Specify the system under evaluation, target users, and usage context. Identify whether adoption is voluntary or mandatory.

### Step 2 — Measure core constructs

**TAM constructs:**
- Perceived Usefulness (PU): "Using X improves my job performance"
- Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU): "Using X is free of effort"

**UTAUT constructs:**
| Construct | Definition | TAM Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Performance Expectancy | Degree system helps job performance | PU |
| Effort Expectancy | Ease of using the system | PEOU |
| Social Influence | Important others think I should use it | Subjective Norm |
| Facilitating Conditions | Infrastructure supports use | (external) |

### Step 3 — Identify moderators and barriers

Map moderating variables: age, gender, experience, voluntariness. Identify specific barriers per construct (e.g., poor training → low Effort Expectancy).

### Step 4 — Design interventions

Target the weakest construct(s) with specific interventions: training (Effort), demonstrations of value (Performance), champion programs (Social), IT support (Facilitating).

## Gotchas

- TAM explains intention, not actual sustained use — add habit and continuance constructs for long-term prediction
- PEOU has diminishing effect as users gain experience; PU dominates over time
- Social Influence matters most under mandatory settings and for early adopters
- Self-report bias inflates correlations between constructs (common method variance)
- UTAUT2 adds hedonic motivation, price value, and habit for consumer contexts
- Cultural context shifts construct weights — do not assume Western-validated weights universally apply

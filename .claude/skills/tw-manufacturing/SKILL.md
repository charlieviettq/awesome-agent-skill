# Taiwan Manufacturing Industry

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Taiwan Manufacturing = Global Supply Chain Chokepoint

Taiwan's manufacturing is NOT just domestic industry — it's a critical
node in global supply chains. TSMC alone produces ~90% of the world's
most advanced chips. Analyzing Taiwan manufacturing without the global
supply chain context misses the point entirely.

### Taiwan Manufacturing Structure

| Sector | Global Position | Key Companies | Revenue Scale |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Semiconductor** | #1 foundry (TSMC), #1 packaging (ASE) | TSMC, UMC, ASE, MediaTek | ~NT$4T+ |
| **Electronics/ICT** | #1 laptop/server ODM | Foxconn, Quanta, Pegatron, Wistron | ~NT$10T+ |
| **Flat panel display** | #2 (after China) | AUO, Innolux | ~NT$500B |
| **Machinery** | Major machine tool exporter | Hiwin, Tongtai, Fair Friend | ~NT$1T |
| **Petrochemical** | Top 10 globally | Formosa Plastics Group, CPC | ~NT$2T |
| **Bicycle** | #1 premium bicycle maker | Giant, Merida | ~NT$100B |
| **Textile** | Leading functional fabric | Far Eastern, Eclat | ~NT$300B |

### Key Characteristics

- **OEM/ODM model**: Taiwan excels at manufacturing for global brands, not building its own consumer brands (exceptions: ASUS, HTC, Giant)
- **SME-dominated**: 98% of Taiwan companies are SMEs (<200 employees). The manufacturing base is a network of specialized SMEs, not a few megacorps
- **Cluster geography**: Hsinchu (semiconductor), Taichung (machinery/bikes), Tainan (optoelectronics), Kaohsiung (petrochemical/steel)
- **Japan connection**: Many Taiwan manufacturers supply Japanese companies and adopted Japanese production methods (Toyota Production System, TQM)

### Industry Analysis Framework

For any Taiwan manufacturing sector:
1. **Global position**: What share of global production? Indispensable or replaceable?
2. **Value chain position**: OEM (low margin) → ODM (medium) → OBM (high)
3. **Key customers**: Who are the major buyers? (Apple, NVIDIA, etc.)
4. **Geopolitical risk**: Cross-strait tensions, US-China decoupling impact
5. **Talent pipeline**: Engineering talent supply, brain drain concerns
6. **ESG transition**: Carbon reduction targets, RE100 commitments, circular economy

## Gotchas

- **"Taiwan semiconductor" is not monolithic**: TSMC (foundry), MediaTek (fabless design), ASE (packaging) are very different businesses. Don't lump them together.
- **Revenue ≠ profit in ODM**: Foxconn has massive revenue (~NT$6T) but thin margins (~2-3%). Revenue ranking can be misleading for profitability analysis.
- **Geopolitical risk is THE issue**: Any analysis of Taiwan manufacturing that ignores cross-strait risk is incomplete. Investors, customers, and governments are actively evaluating this.
- **"Silicon Shield" theory**: Taiwan's semiconductor dominance is argued to be a deterrent against military conflict because the global economy depends on it. This is debated and should not be presented as fact.

# Pitch Deck

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: 10-15 Slides, One Idea Per Slide

Investors see 100+ decks per month. They spend 3-4 minutes on average.
Every slide must earn its place. If a slide doesn't advance the core
narrative (problem → solution → why us → why now), cut it.
```

### Standard Pitch Deck Structure (12 Slides)

| # | Slide | Purpose | Time |
|---|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | **Title** | Company name, one-line description, your name | 10 sec |
| 2 | **Problem** | The pain point — specific, relatable, data-backed | 30 sec |
| 3 | **Solution** | How you solve it — clear, concrete | 30 sec |
| 4 | **Demo/Product** | Show, don't tell — screenshot, video, or flow | 45 sec |
| 5 | **Market Size** | TAM → SAM → SOM with methodology | 30 sec |
| 6 | **Business Model** | How you make money — pricing, unit economics | 30 sec |
| 7 | **Traction** | What you've achieved — revenue, users, growth rate | 30 sec |
| 8 | **Competition** | 2×2 positioning map — where you win | 20 sec |
| 9 | **Team** | Why THIS team wins — relevant experience | 20 sec |
| 10 | **Financials** | 3-year projection — revenue, key assumptions | 30 sec |
| 11 | **The Ask** | How much, what for, what milestones it enables | 20 sec |
| 12 | **Contact** | Name, email, next step | 5 sec |

### Slide-by-Slide Guide

**Problem Slide:**
- Make the audience FEEL the pain
- Use a specific example or data point ("40% of SMBs spend 20+ hrs/month on manual invoicing")
- Avoid abstract problems ("businesses need better solutions")

**Market Size:**
- TAM = Total Addressable Market (if you captured 100%)
- SAM = Serviceable Addressable Market (your segment)
- SOM = Serviceable Obtainable Market (realistic 3-year target)
- Show methodology, not just a number

**Traction Slide (most important for fundraising):**
- Revenue curve (up and to the right)
- Growth rate (MoM or YoY)
- Key milestones: customers, partnerships, product launches
- If pre-revenue: waitlist, LOIs, pilot results

**Competition Slide:**
- 2×2 matrix, NOT a feature comparison table
- Choose axes that make you the clear winner in the top-right
- Include indirect competitors and substitutes

**The Ask:**
- Amount: specific number ("NT$30M Series A")
- Use of funds: top 3 allocations (product 40%, sales 35%, operations 25%)
- Milestones the funding enables ("reach $1M ARR, expand to 3 markets")

## Design Guidelines

- Max words per slide: 30-40
- One chart/visual per slide maximum
```

## Gotchas

- **Traction trumps everything**: A deck with amazing traction and mediocre design beats a beautiful deck with no traction. Lead with your strongest metric.
- **Don't read slides aloud**: Slides are visual aids. You tell the story; slides provide evidence. If you're reading bullets, there are too many bullets.
- **"We have no competition" = red flag**: Investors know this means you haven't researched. There's always competition — even if it's "doing nothing" or "using a spreadsheet."
- **Financial projections WILL be questioned**: "How did you get to $10M Y3?" Have a bottom-up model ready. Top-down market share assumptions are weak alone.
- **Send a condensed version for email**: The presentation deck (with minimal text, big visuals) differs from the email/read-ahead deck (more text, self-explanatory). Prepare both.

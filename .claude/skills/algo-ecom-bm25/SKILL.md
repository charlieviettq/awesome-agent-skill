# BM25 Ranking Function

## Overview

BM25 (Best Matching 25) is an improved TF-IDF ranking function that adds term frequency saturation and document length normalization. Score = Σ IDF(t) × (TF(t,d) × (k₁+1)) / (TF(t,d) + k₁ × (1 - b + b × |d|/avgdl)). Standard parameters: k₁=1.2, b=0.75. The backbone of most text search engines (Elasticsearch, Solr).

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Building product search with text-based relevance ranking
- Replacing basic TF-IDF with better document length normalization
- Tuning search relevance in Elasticsearch/Solr

**When NOT to use:**
- When semantic similarity matters more than keyword matching (use embeddings)
- For single-field exact matching (simpler methods suffice)

## Algorithm

```
IRON LAW: BM25 Has Two Critical Parameters — k₁ and b
k₁ controls term frequency saturation: higher k₁ = more weight to
repeated terms. k₁=0 ignores TF entirely (boolean).
b controls document length normalization: b=1 fully normalizes by
length, b=0 ignores length. Default k₁=1.2, b=0.75 works for most
cases but MUST be tuned for your specific corpus.
```

### Phase 1: Input Validation + Tokenization
Tokenize each document to lowercase word tokens. **Remove stop words** before
counting — the bundled script drops a standard English stop list (`the, a, an,
and, or, but, of, in, on, at, to, for, with, by, from, as, is, are, was, were,
be, been, being`). Then build an inverted index: term → list of (document, term
frequency). Compute: document lengths (post stop-word removal), average document
length, document frequency per term.

> ⚠️ **Stop-word removal affects `|d|` and `avgdl`**: because stop words are
> dropped before length is measured, hand-computing BM25 without removing them
> will give the wrong length normalization and scores will be off by 3–5%.
> If you're reproducing BM25 by hand to compare against the script, apply the
> same stop list first — or just run the script.

**Gate:** Index built, statistics computed, corpus non-empty.

### Phase 2: Core Algorithm
For query Q with terms t₁...tₙ against document d:
1. For each query term tᵢ: compute IDF(tᵢ) = log((N - DF(tᵢ) + 0.5) / (DF(tᵢ) + 0.5) + 1)
2. Compute TF component: (TF(tᵢ,d) × (k₁+1)) / (TF(tᵢ,d) + k₁ × (1 - b + b × |d|/avgdl))
3. Score(d, Q) = Σᵢ IDF(tᵢ) × TF_component(tᵢ, d)
4. Rank documents by score descending

> ⚠️ **IDF variant lock-in**: BM25 has several IDF formulations in the wild
> (Robertson-Sparck Jones, classic Okapi, Lucene's smoothed `+1`, BM25+, BM25L).
> This skill — and the bundled script — uses the **Lucene-style smoothed variant**
> shown above (`log((N - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5) + 1)`), which never returns negative
> IDF for very common terms. If you compare scores against another engine
> (Elasticsearch, Solr, Whoosh), they may differ by ~3–5% even on identical inputs.
> Do not "correct" the script unless you intend to change the variant globally.

### Phase 3: Verification
Spot-check: query "red shoes" should rank documents containing both "red" and "shoes" higher than documents with only one term. Shorter product titles with both terms should rank above long descriptions with sparse mentions.
**Gate:** Relevance spot-check passes on 10+ test queries.

### Phase 4: Output
Return ranked results with scores.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "results": [{"doc_id": "SKU-123", "score": 12.5, "title": "Red Running Shoes"}],
  "metadata": {"query": "red shoes", "hits": 85, "k1": 1.2, "b": 0.75, "avg_doc_length": 45}
}
```

## Examples

### Sample I/O
**Input:** Query "wireless earbuds", corpus of 1000 product listings
**Expected:** Products with "wireless earbuds" in title rank highest; "wireless headphones" ranks lower (no "earbuds" term).

### Edge Cases
| Input | Expected | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Single-word query | IDF-dominated ranking | Only one term's IDF differentiates |
| Very common term ("the") | Near-zero IDF, low impact | IDF suppresses common terms |
| Document with 100 repetitions | Saturated TF, not 100x score | k₁ caps the benefit of repetition |

## Gotchas

- **Multi-field scoring**: E-commerce products have title, description, brand, category. Weight fields differently: title match > description match. Use field-boosted BM25.
- **Synonyms and stemming**: BM25 is keyword-exact. "earphones" won't match "earbuds." Add synonym expansion and stemming in the query pipeline.
- **Parameter tuning**: Default k₁=1.2, b=0.75 is reasonable but not optimal. Tune on relevance judgments specific to your catalog.
- **Numeric attributes**: BM25 doesn't handle numeric filtering (price range, ratings). Use it for text relevance, then combine with numeric filters.
- **Zero-result queries**: When BM25 returns nothing, fall back to fuzzy matching or semantic search rather than showing empty results.

## Scripts

| Script | Description | Usage |

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
```

Then commit the change: `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: add gstack skill routing rules to CLAUDE.md"`

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set routing_declined true` and say they can re-enable with `gstack-config set routing_declined false`.

This only happens once per project. Skip if `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`.

If `VENDORED_GSTACK` is `yes`, warn once via AskUserQuestion unless `~/.gstack/.vendoring-warned-$SLUG` exists:

> This project has gstack vendored in `.claude/skills/gstack/`. Vendoring is deprecated.
> Migrate to team mode?

Options:
- A) Yes, migrate to team mode now
- B) No, I'll handle it myself

If A:
1. Run `git rm -r .claude/skills/gstack/`
2. Run `echo '.claude/skills/gstack/' >> .gitignore`
3. Run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-team-init required` (or `optional`)
4. Run `git add .claude/ .gitignore CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: migrate gstack from vendored to team mode"`
5. Tell the user: "Done. Each developer now runs: `cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack && ./setup --team`"

If B: say "OK, you're on your own to keep the vendored copy up to date."

Always run (regardless of choice):
```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || true
touch ~/.gstack/.vendoring-warned-${SLUG:-unknown}
```

If marker exists, skip.

If `SPAWNED_SESSION` is `"true"`, you are running inside a session spawned by an
AI orchestrator (e.g., OpenClaw). In spawned sessions:
- Do NOT use AskUserQuestion for interactive prompts. Auto-choose the recommended option.
- Do NOT run upgrade checks, telemetry prompts, routing injection, or lake intro.
- Focus on completing the task and reporting results via prose output.
- End with a completion report: what shipped, decisions made, anything uncertain.

## User-invocable
When the user types `/setup-deploy`, run this skill.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check existing configuration

```bash
grep -A 20 "## Deploy Configuration" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONFIG"
```

If configuration already exists, show it and ask:

- **Context:** Deploy configuration already exists in CLAUDE.md.
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose A to update if your setup changed.
- A) Reconfigure from scratch (overwrite existing)
- B) Edit specific fields (show current config, let me change one thing)
- C) Done — configuration looks correct

If the user picks C, stop.

### Step 2: Detect platform

Run the platform detection from the deploy bootstrap:

```bash
# Platform config files
[ -f fly.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:fly" && cat fly.toml
[ -f render.yaml ] && echo "PLATFORM:render" && cat render.yaml
[ -f vercel.json ] || [ -d .vercel ] && echo "PLATFORM:vercel"
[ -f netlify.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:netlify" && cat netlify.toml
[ -f Procfile ] && echo "PLATFORM:heroku"
[ -f railway.json ] || [ -f railway.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:railway"

# GitHub Actions deploy workflows
for f in $(find .github/workflows -maxdepth 1 \( -name '*.yml' -o -name '*.yaml' \) 2>/dev/null); do
  [ -f "$f" ] && grep -qiE "deploy|release|production|staging|cd" "$f" 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPLOY_WORKFLOW:$f"
done

# Project type
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"bin"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "PROJECT_TYPE:cli"
find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.gemspec' 2>/dev/null | grep -q . && echo "PROJECT_TYPE:library"
```

### Step 3: Platform-specific setup

Based on what was detected, guide the user through platform-specific configuration.

#### Fly.io

If `fly.toml` detected:

1. Extract app name: `grep -m1 "^app" fly.toml | sed 's/app = "\(.*\)"/\1/'`
2. Check if `fly` CLI is installed: `which fly 2>/dev/null`
3. If installed, verify: `fly status --app {app} 2>/dev/null`
4. Infer URL: `https://{app}.fly.dev`
5. Set deploy status command: `fly status --app {app}`
6. Set health check: `https://{app}.fly.dev` (or `/health` if the app has one)

Ask the user to confirm the production URL. Some Fly apps use custom domains.

#### Render

If `render.yaml` detected:

1. Extract service name and type from render.yaml
2. Check for Render API key: `echo $RENDER_API_KEY | head -c 4` (don't expose the full key)
3. Infer URL: `https://{service-name}.onrender.com`
4. Render deploys automatically on push to the connected branch — no deploy workflow needed
5. Set health check: the inferred URL

Ask the user to confirm. Render uses auto-deploy from the connected git branch — after
merge to main, Render picks it up automatically. The "deploy wait" in /land-and-deploy
should poll the Render URL until it responds with the new version.

#### Vercel

If vercel.json or .vercel detected:

1. Check for `vercel` CLI: `which vercel 2>/dev/null`
2. If installed: `vercel ls --prod 2>/dev/null | head -3`
3. Vercel deploys automatically on push — preview on PR, production on merge to main
4. Set health check: the production URL from vercel project settings

#### Netlify

If netlify.toml detected:

1. Extract site info from netlify.toml
2. Netlify deploys automatically on push
3. Set health check: the production URL

#### GitHub Actions only

If deploy workflows detected but no platform config:

1. Read the workflow file to understand what it does
2. Extract the deploy target (if mentioned)
3. Ask the user for the production URL

#### Custom / Manual

If nothing detected:

Use AskUserQuestion to gather the information:

1. **How are deploys triggered?**
   - A) Automatically on push to main (Fly, Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - B) Via GitHub Actions workflow
   - C) Via a deploy script or CLI command (describe it)
   - D) Manually (SSH, dashboard, etc.)
   - E) This project doesn't deploy (library, CLI, tool)

2. **What's the production URL?** (Free text — the URL where the app runs)

3. **How can gstack check if a deploy succeeded?**
   - A) HTTP health check at a specific URL (e.g., /health, /api/status)
   - B) CLI command (e.g., `fly status`, `kubectl rollout status`)
   - C) Check the GitHub Actions workflow status
   - D) No automated way — just check the URL loads

4. **Any pre-merge or post-merge hooks?**
   - Commands to run before merging (e.g., `bun run build`)
   - Commands to run after merge but before deploy verification

### Step 4: Write configuration

Read CLAUDE.md (or create it). Find and replace the `## Deploy Configuration` section
if it exists, or append it at the end.

```markdown
## Deploy Configuration (configured by /setup-deploy)
- Platform: {platform}
- Production URL: {url}
- Deploy workflow: {workflow file or "auto-deploy on push"}
- Deploy status command: {command or "HTTP health check"}
- Merge method: {squash/merge/rebase}
- Project type: {web app / API / CLI / library}
- Post-deploy health check: {health check URL or command}

### Custom deploy hooks
- Pre-merge: {command or "none"}
- Deploy trigger: {command or "automatic on push to main"}
- Deploy status: {command or "poll production URL"}
- Health check: {URL or command}
```

### Step 5: Verify

After writing, verify the configuration works:

1. If a health check URL was configured, try it:
```bash
curl -sf "{health-check-url}" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" 2>/dev/null || echo "UNREACHABLE"
```

2. If a deploy status command was configured, try it:
```bash
{deploy-status-command} 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "COMMAND_FAILED"
```

Report results. If anything failed, note it but don't block — the config is still
useful even if the health check is temporarily unreachable.

### Step 6: Summary

```
DEPLOY CONFIGURATION — COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════
Platform:      {platform}
URL:           {url}
Health check:  {health check}
Status cmd:    {status command}
Merge method:  {merge method}

Saved to CLAUDE.md. /land-and-deploy will use these settings automatically.

Next steps:
- Run /land-and-deploy to merge and deploy your current PR
- Edit the "## Deploy Configuration" section in CLAUDE.md to change settings
- Run /setup-deploy again to reconfigure
```

## Important Rules

- **Never expose secrets.** Don't print full API keys, tokens, or passwords.
- **Confirm with the user.** Always show the detected config and ask for confirmation before writing.
- **CLAUDE.md is the source of truth.** All configuration lives there — not in a separate config file.
- **Idempotent.** Running /setup-deploy multiple times overwrites the previous config cleanly.
- **Platform CLIs are optional.** If `fly` or `vercel` CLI isn't installed, fall back to URL-based health checks.

# Resource-Based View (RBV)

## Overview

The Resource-Based View argues that firms achieve sustained competitive advantage through resources that are heterogeneous and immobile across firms. Barney (1991) formalized the VRIO framework as the diagnostic test.

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether internal resources create durable competitive advantage
- Auditing a resource portfolio for strategic importance
- Justifying make-vs-acquire decisions for capabilities
- Comparing resource positions across competitors

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: A resource must satisfy ALL four VRIO criteria simultaneously
to generate sustained competitive advantage. Failing ANY single
criterion downgrades the outcome.
```

Key assumptions:
1. Resource heterogeneity — firms possess different bundles of resources
2. Resource immobility — resources cannot be freely traded across firms
3. Managers can identify and evaluate resources accurately

## Methodology

### VRIO Analysis Steps

1. **Inventory resources** — List tangible, intangible, and human capital resources
2. **Apply VRIO test to each resource:**

| Criterion | Question | If NO |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **V**alue | Does it exploit opportunity or neutralize threat? | Competitive disadvantage |
| **R**arity | Is it controlled by few firms? | Competitive parity |
| **I**mitability | Is it costly to imitate? (history, ambiguity, complexity, patents) | Temporary advantage |
| **O**rganization | Is the firm organized to capture value? | Unrealized advantage |

3. **Classify outcome** — Map each resource to its competitive implication
4. **Prioritize** — Focus strategic investment on V+R+I+O resources

### Imitability Barriers (Isolating Mechanisms)

- Unique historical conditions
- Causal ambiguity
- Social complexity
- Patents and legal protections

## Output Format

## RBV / VRIO Analysis: [Context]

### Resource Inventory
| Resource | Type | V | R | I | O | Implication |
|----------|------|---|---|---|---|-------------|
| [name]   | [tangible/intangible/human] | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | Y/N | [outcome] |

### Key Findings
- Sustained advantage resources: ...
- Temporary advantage resources: ...
- Parity resources: ...

### Strategic Recommendations
1. [Protect/invest in VRIO resources]
2. [Develop missing criteria for near-VRIO resources]
3. [Divest or deprioritize parity resources]
```

## Examples

### Good Example
Analyze a tech firm's proprietary algorithm: classified as V+R+I (causal ambiguity) but lacking O (no team to commercialize) — recommendation to build organizational support.

### Bad Example
Listing "brand" as VRIO without specifying which competitors lack equivalent brands or why imitation is costly. VRIO requires granular, evidence-backed assessment per criterion.

## Gotchas

- VRIO is static — combine with dynamic capabilities for changing environments
- "Organization" is often overlooked; a VRIO resource without organizational support yields nothing
- Resources are firm-specific; the same resource may be V in one industry and not in another
- Intangible resources (culture, reputation) are hardest to assess but often most valuable
- Do not conflate "rare" with "unique" — rare means few competitors possess it

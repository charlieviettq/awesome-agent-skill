# SERVQUAL Model

## Overview

SERVQUAL measures service quality as the gap between customer expectations and perceptions across five dimensions: Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy. The broader Gap Model identifies five organizational gaps that cause service quality failures.

## When to Use

- Measuring and benchmarking service quality
- Identifying which service dimensions need improvement
- Diagnosing root causes of customer dissatisfaction
- Comparing service quality across branches, competitors, or time periods

## When NOT to Use

- Evaluating product quality (use Garvin's 8 dimensions)
- When only transaction-level satisfaction is needed (use CSAT/NPS)
- Pure self-service digital products with no human interaction component

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Service quality = Perception − Expectation. Both sides MUST
be measured independently. Measuring only satisfaction conflates the
two and hides diagnostic insight.
```

Key assumptions:
1. Customers form expectations before the service encounter
2. Quality is judged comparatively (perception vs expectation)
3. The five dimensions are universal across service industries
4. Gaps are additive — multiple small gaps compound into poor overall quality

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Measure expectations and perceptions

Administer paired 7-point Likert scales for each dimension (22 items total):

| Dimension | Focus | Example Item |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Tangibles** | Physical facilities, equipment, appearance | "Modern-looking equipment" |
| **Reliability** | Deliver promised service dependably | "Provide service at promised time" |
| **Responsiveness** | Willingness to help, prompt service | "Employees give prompt service" |
| **Assurance** | Knowledge, courtesy, trust | "Employees instill confidence" |
| **Empathy** | Caring, individualized attention | "Understand specific needs" |

### Step 2 — Calculate gap scores

Gap Score = Perception Score − Expectation Score (negative = shortfall)

### Step 3 — Diagnose organizational gaps

| Gap | Description | Root Cause |
|-----|------------|------------|
| Gap 1 | Management perception vs customer expectation | Poor market research |
| Gap 2 | Service quality specs vs management perception | Inadequate standards |
| Gap 3 | Service delivery vs specifications | Poor execution |
| Gap 4 | External communication vs delivery | Overpromising |
| Gap 5 | Customer perception vs expectation | Cumulative result of Gaps 1-4 |

### Step 4 — Prioritize and intervene

Rank dimensions by gap magnitude weighted by importance. Target the largest negative gaps first.

## Gotchas

- Expectation scores tend to cluster high (ceiling effect), compressing diagnostic variance
- The 22-item instrument is often adapted — document any modifications for validity
- Reliability and Responsiveness typically dominate importance weights across industries
- Zone of tolerance exists between desired and adequate expectations — measure both for richer insight
- SERVPERF (Cronin & Taylor, 1992) argues perception-only measurement is sufficient — know the debate
- Cultural norms shift dimension weights: collectivist cultures weight Empathy higher

# Taiwan Retail Landscape

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Convenience Stores Are Taiwan's Retail Infrastructure

Taiwan has the world's second-highest convenience store density (~13,000
stores for 23M people = 1 per ~1,800 people). CVS is not just retail —
it's logistics (pickup), payment (bill pay), food service, and daily life
infrastructure. ANY retail strategy in Taiwan must account for CVS as
a channel, competitor, AND partner.
```

## Gotchas

- **PX Mart negotiating power**: With ~1,100 stores and dominant market share, PX Mart has enormous buyer power. Listing fees, promotional requirements, and margin expectations are aggressive.
- **CVS shelf space is tiny**: A convenience store carries 2,000-3,000 SKUs in ~30 ping of space. Getting shelf space is extremely competitive. New products get 2-4 weeks to prove sales, then get cut.
- **Seasonality is concentrated**: Department store anniversary sales (百貨週年慶, Sep-Nov), 雙11, Chinese New Year, and Mother's Day account for a disproportionate share of annual retail revenue. Plan inventory and marketing accordingly.
- **E-commerce logistics expectation**: Taiwan consumers expect same-day or next-day delivery. Anything longer feels slow. Free shipping threshold battles continue (momo raised then lowered multiple times).

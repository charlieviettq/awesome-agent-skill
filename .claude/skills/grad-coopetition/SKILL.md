# Co-opetition: The Value Net (Brandenburger & Nalebuff, 1996)

## Overview

Co-opetition recognizes that business relationships are never purely competitive or purely cooperative. The Value Net model extends Porter's focus on rivalry by adding complementors — players whose products increase the value of yours. The PARTS framework (Players, Added value, Rules, Tactics, Scope) provides a structured approach to changing the game rather than just playing it.

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- User is analyzing a relationship that is simultaneously cooperative and competitive
- User asks about strategic alliances with competitors
- User needs to identify complementors or map all players in a value network
- User mentions "frenemy", "coopetition", "complementors", or "value net"

**When NOT to use:**
- For pure competitive analysis -> use Porter's Five Forces
- For internal organizational balance -> use grad-ambidexterity
- For international market entry mode -> use grad-oli

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Every Business Relationship Contains BOTH Cooperative
          and Competitive Elements

There is NO purely competitive or purely cooperative relationship.
A supplier cooperates (provides inputs) AND competes (captures margin).
A competitor competes (takes share) AND cooperates (grows the category).

Any analysis that labels a player as ONLY competitor or ONLY partner
is incomplete. Always map BOTH dimensions.
```

- Business is a game — but players can change the game, not just play it
- Value creation is cooperative; value capture is competitive
- The same player can be a competitor AND a complementor simultaneously

## Methodology

### Step 1: Map the Value Net

Place the focal firm at the center and map four player types: Customers, Suppliers, Competitors (whose products DECREASE your value), and Complementors (whose products INCREASE your value). Key insight: a player can occupy multiple roles (Samsung supplies displays to Apple AND sells competing phones).

### Step 2: Assess Added Value

For each player, calculate added value:
- **Added value** = Total value of the game WITH the player MINUS total value WITHOUT the player
- A player can never capture more than their added value
- Strategies should aim to increase YOUR added value and manage others'

### Step 3: Apply PARTS Framework

Systematically evaluate five levers to change the game:

| Lever | Question | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Players** | Who is in the game? Should we add/remove players? | Bring in new complementors, attract new competitors to reduce supplier power |
| **Added value** | How can we increase our added value? | Differentiate, build switching costs, create loyal customers |
| **Rules** | What rules govern the game? Can we change them? | Contracts, regulations, industry standards, MFN clauses |
| **Tactics** | How do perceptions shape the game? | Signaling, commitments, transparency vs fog |
| **Scope** | What is the boundary of the game? | Link or de-link games, expand or narrow scope |

### Step 4: Design Co-opetition Strategy

For each key relationship, specify:
- Where to cooperate (value creation): joint R&D, standard setting, market expansion
- Where to compete (value capture): pricing, customer acquisition, differentiation
- Boundary rules: what information to share, what to protect

# Co-opetition Analysis: {Focal Firm}

## Value Net Map
- Customers / Suppliers / Competitors / Complementors: {list each, note dual roles}

## Added Value Assessment
| Player | Added Value | Leverage |

| {Focal firm} | {assessment} | {high/medium/low} |

## PARTS Analysis
| Lever | Current State | Recommended Change |

| Players / Added value / Rules / Tactics / Scope | {current} | {action} |

## Co-opetition Strategy
- Cooperate on: {activities} | Compete on: {activities} | Boundary rules: {policy}
```

## Gotchas

- **Complementor identification is the hardest part**: Force yourself to ask: "Whose product makes mine more valuable?" The biggest insights hide here.
- **Dual roles create tension**: When a partner is also a competitor, define explicit information boundaries.
- **Added value is dynamic**: Every major move changes everyone's added value. Reassess after launches or market entries.
- **Cooperation without boundaries leads to knowledge leakage**: Alliances need explicit IP firewalls.
- **PARTS is about changing the game**: If your analysis only describes the current game, you missed the point.

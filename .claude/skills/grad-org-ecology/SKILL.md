# Organizational Ecology (Hannan & Freeman)

## Overview

Organizational ecology applies population-level evolutionary logic to organizations. Rather than asking why individual firms succeed or fail, it asks why certain organizational forms proliferate or decline across populations. The theory emphasizes selection over adaptation: environmental change is met more by the founding of new organizations and the failure of old ones than by incumbent transformation.

## When to Use

- Explaining industry-level patterns of organizational founding and failure
- Analyzing why established organizations resist change (structural inertia)
- Evaluating liabilities of newness, smallness, or adolescence for startups
- Understanding density dependence in industry evolution (legitimation vs. competition)

## When NOT to Use

- When the focus is on individual firm strategy and managerial agency
- When the analysis requires prescriptive recommendations for a single organization
- When the population boundaries cannot be defined meaningfully

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Selection operates on POPULATIONS, not individual organizations —
organizational change is driven more by founding and failure than by
adaptation. Any analysis that assumes incumbent firms can readily
transform themselves violates the structural inertia thesis.
```

Key assumptions:
1. Structural inertia — internal and external pressures make organizations resistant to change
2. Selection favors reliable and accountable organizations, which reinforces inertia
3. Environmental change drives population-level change via differential founding and mortality
4. Organizational forms compete within and across populations for resources

## Methodology

### Step 1: Define the Population

Identify the organizational form and population boundaries. Populations share a common form (technology, structure, market orientation).

### Step 2: Analyze Density Dependence

| Phase | Density | Legitimation | Competition | Net Effect |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Early | Low | Rising fast | Low | Founding rate increases |
| Growth | Medium | High | Rising | Peak founding, rising failure |
| Mature | High | Saturated | Intense | Founding slows, failure rises |
| Decline | Falling | Declining | Easing | Population contracts |

### Step 3: Assess Structural Inertia and Liabilities

| Factor | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Structural inertia** | Internal (sunk costs, politics, norms) and external (barriers, legitimacy) pressures resist change | Limits adaptation |
| **Liability of newness** | New organizations lack routines, legitimacy, and stable relationships | Higher early failure rate |
| **Liability of smallness** | Small organizations have fewer resources to buffer environmental shocks | Size-dependent mortality |
| **Liability of adolescence** | Organizations fail after initial resources deplete but before routines establish | Delayed mortality peak |
| **Liability of aging** | Older organizations accumulate structural rigidity | Vulnerability to environmental shifts |

### Step 4: Evaluate Selection Dynamics

Analyze founding rates, failure rates, and the relative contribution of selection vs. adaptation to population-level change.

## Organizational Ecology Analysis: [Context]

### Population Definition
- Organizational form: [description]
- Population boundaries: [geographic, temporal, industry]
- Current density: [approximate number of organizations]

### Density Dependence Assessment
- Current phase: [early / growth / mature / decline]
- Legitimation level: [H/M/L]
- Competition intensity: [H/M/L]
- Predicted trajectory: [founding/failure rate trends]

### Inertia and Liability Assessment
| Factor | Severity | Evidence |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Structural inertia | [H/M/L] | [specific evidence] |
| Liability of newness | [H/M/L] | [specific evidence] |
| Liability of smallness | [H/M/L] | [specific evidence] |
| Liability of adolescence | [H/M/L] | [specific evidence] |
| Liability of aging | [H/M/L] | [specific evidence] |

### Selection vs. Adaptation
- Proportion of change via selection (founding + failure): ...
- Proportion of change via adaptation (incumbent transformation): ...

### Implications
1. [What the population-level dynamics predict for this industry]
2. [Whether new entrants or incumbents are favored by current conditions]

## Gotchas

- Organizational ecology deliberately de-emphasizes managerial agency — do not use it to advise individual firm strategy
- Structural inertia does not mean organizations NEVER change; it means change attempts often increase failure risk
- The liability of newness and liability of aging can coexist in the same population at different life stages
- Density dependence is non-monotonic — legitimation dominates at low density, competition at high density
- Resource partitioning theory (Carroll, 1985) extends ecology to explain specialist survival in concentrated markets
- Do not confuse organizational ecology with biological metaphors — the mechanisms are sociological (legitimacy, competition), not genetic

# OEE Analysis

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality

OEE is a MULTIPLICATIVE metric. 90% × 90% × 90% = 72.9%, not 90%.
Each factor compounds the loss. World-class OEE is 85%+. Most plants
operate at 60-65%. Knowing the TOTAL is useless — you must decompose
to find which factor is dragging performance down.
```

### The Three Factors

| Factor | Formula | Measures | Loss Categories |
|--------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Availability** | Run Time / Planned Production Time | Uptime vs downtime | Equipment failures, changeovers, material shortages |
| **Performance** | (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Count) / Run Time | Actual speed vs design speed | Minor stops, slow running, idling |
| **Quality** | Good Count / Total Count | Yield, first-pass quality | Defects, rework, scrap, startup rejects |

### Six Big Losses (mapped to OEE factors)

| Loss | OEE Factor | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1. Equipment failure | Availability | Machine breakdown, unplanned repair |
| 2. Setup & changeover | Availability | Product changeover, die change, cleaning |
| 3. Idling & minor stops | Performance | Sensor blockage, jam clearing, small adjustments |
| 4. Reduced speed | Performance | Running below rated speed due to wear or material |
| 5. Process defects | Quality | In-process rejects, rework |
| 6. Startup rejects | Quality | Scrap during warm-up, first-article failures |

### Calculation Example

```
Planned Production Time: 480 min (8-hour shift)
Downtime (breakdowns + changeover): 60 min
Run Time: 420 min

Ideal Cycle Time: 1 min/unit
Total Units Produced: 380

Good Units: 360
Defective Units: 20

Availability = 420 / 480 = 87.5%
Performance = (1 × 380) / 420 = 90.5%
Quality = 360 / 380 = 94.7%

OEE = 87.5% × 90.5% × 94.7% = 75.0%
```

### Diagnosis Steps

**Phase 1: Calculate OEE** for each production line/machine
**Phase 2: Identify the weakest factor** (Availability, Performance, or Quality)
**Phase 3: Pareto the losses** within that factor (which specific loss is biggest?)
**Phase 4: Root cause analysis** on the top loss (5 Whys, fishbone)
**Phase 5: Improve** and remeasure

### Benchmarks

| OEE Level | Rating | Typical |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| > 85% | World-class | Top manufacturers |
| 60-85% | Typical | Room for improvement |
| 40-60% | Low | Significant losses, urgent action needed |
| < 40% | Critical | Equipment or process fundamentally broken |

## Gotchas

- **OEE is per machine, not per plant**: Plant-level OEE averages hide that one machine at 95% and another at 45% average to 70%. Analyze individually.
- **Planned downtime is excluded**: OEE measures losses against PLANNED production time. Scheduled maintenance, no-production shifts, and planned shutdowns are excluded from the denominator.
- **100% OEE is not the goal**: It would mean zero changeovers, zero defects, running at max speed 100% of the time. Pursuing 100% can increase costs (e.g., never doing preventive maintenance). Target 85%+ for critical lines.
- **Data collection is the real challenge**: Manual OEE tracking is inaccurate. Invest in automated data collection (sensors, MES integration) for reliable measurement.

# Conversational Commerce

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Conversation First, Commerce Second

Conversational commerce works because it meets customers WHERE THEY
ALREADY ARE (messaging apps). Forcing a sales pitch into a chat channel
kills trust. The conversation must provide genuine value (answering questions,
solving problems) BEFORE introducing products or purchases.

The sequence: Help → Trust → Recommend → Convert
```

### Platform Comparison (Asia-Pacific Focus)

| Platform | Users (Taiwan) | Commerce Features | Best For |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **LINE** | 21M+ (95% penetration) | LINE Shopping, Rich Menu, LIFF, payment | Taiwan, Japan, Thailand primary channel |
| **Instagram DM** | ~10M | Shop tags, quick replies, product stickers | Visual products, younger demographic |
| **Facebook Messenger** | ~18M | Shops integration, automated responses | Broad reach, older demographic |
| **WhatsApp** | Limited in Taiwan | Catalog, cart, payment (select markets) | SEA, India, Brazil |
| **WeChat** | ~1M (Taiwan) | Mini Programs, WeChat Pay | China-connected businesses |

### Conversation Flow Design

**1. Entry Points** — How customers start the conversation
- QR code in store, ad click-to-message, website chat widget, social media link

**2. Welcome Flow** — First 3 messages
- Greet warmly, set expectations, offer navigation options
- Rich menu (LINE) or quick reply buttons — don't ask open-ended questions early

**3. Product Discovery** — Help them find what they need
- Guided questions: "What are you looking for?" → category → product
- Product cards with image, price, and "Buy" button
- AI-powered recommendations based on conversation context

**4. Purchase Flow** — Minimize friction
- In-chat checkout where possible (LINE Pay, in-app payment)
- If redirecting to website, deep-link to the specific product (not homepage)
- Order confirmation message with tracking

**5. Post-Purchase** — Retain and upsell
- Shipping updates via message
- Follow-up: "How's the product?" (7 days after delivery)
- Personalized recommendations based on purchase history

### Chatbot vs Human Handoff

| Scenario | Handle with Bot | Hand off to Human |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| FAQ (hours, shipping, returns) | ✓ | — |
| Product recommendations (simple) | ✓ | — |
| Complex product questions | — | ✓ |
| Complaints / issues | — | ✓ (immediately) |
| High-value purchases | Bot assists → human closes | ✓ |

**Key metric**: Bot containment rate (% resolved without human) — target 60-70% for mature bots.

```

## Gotchas

- **LINE Official Account tiers matter**: Free tier limits monthly messages. If you exceed, messages are throttled. Budget for premium tier if customer base > 500.
- **Don't over-automate**: A bot that can't understand the question and loops "I didn't understand, please choose from the menu" destroys trust faster than no bot at all. Always offer a human escalation path.
- **Messaging is asynchronous**: Unlike phone calls, customers expect to message and come back later. Design flows that work with interruptions — save cart state, remember context.
- **Privacy in messaging**: Chat history is personal. Don't share conversations internally without consent, and be transparent about data usage.
- **Social commerce is exploding in SEA/Taiwan**: LINE Shopping, Instagram Shopping, TikTok Shop — these blur the line between social and commerce. Treat them as primary channels, not add-ons.

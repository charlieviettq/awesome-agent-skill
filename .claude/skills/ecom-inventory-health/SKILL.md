# Inventory Health Analysis

## Overview

Inventory health balances two risks: stockouts (lost sales, unhappy customers) and overstock (carrying costs, obsolescence). This skill provides tools to measure, classify, and optimize inventory levels.

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Not All SKUs Deserve Equal Attention

ABC classification shows that ~20% of SKUs drive ~80% of revenue.
Treat A-items (top 20% revenue) with tight control and frequent review.
C-items (bottom 50% revenue) get simple rules and less attention.
Equal treatment of all SKUs wastes resources on low-impact items.
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Inventory Turnover** | COGS / Avg Inventory | 4-12x/year (industry-dependent) |
| **Days of Inventory (DOI)** | 365 / Inventory Turnover | 30-90 days |
| **Stockout Rate** | Stockout incidents / Total demand occasions | < 2-5% |
| **Fill Rate** | Orders filled completely / Total orders | > 95% |
| **Carrying Cost** | Avg Inventory × Carrying Cost % (typically 20-30%/year) | Minimize |
| **Dead Stock %** | Items with zero sales in 6+ months / Total SKUs | < 10% |

### ABC Classification

| Class | Revenue % | SKU % | Strategy |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| **A** | ~80% | ~20% | Tight control, frequent review, safety stock optimized |
| **B** | ~15% | ~30% | Moderate control, periodic review |
| **C** | ~5% | ~50% | Simple rules, min/max levels, consider dropping |

### Safety Stock Calculation

```
Safety Stock = Z × σ_d × √(Lead Time)

Where:
- Z = service level factor (1.65 for 95%, 2.33 for 99%)
- σ_d = standard deviation of daily demand
- Lead Time = supplier lead time in days
```

### Reorder Point

```
Reorder Point = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

### Diagnosis Steps

**Phase 1: Overall Health Check**
- Calculate turnover and DOI for total inventory
- Compare to industry benchmarks
- Identify trend: improving or deteriorating?

**Phase 2: ABC Classification**
- Rank all SKUs by revenue contribution
- Classify into A/B/C
- Check: are A-items well-stocked? Are C-items over-stocked?

**Phase 3: Problem Identification**
- **Overstock**: DOI > 90 days, dead stock > 10%, carrying costs rising
- **Stockout**: Fill rate < 95%, lost sales reports, customer complaints
- **Imbalance**: A-items understocked while C-items overstocked

**Phase 4: Optimization**
- Set safety stock by ABC class
- Implement reorder points for A-items
- Liquidate dead stock (discount, bundle, donate)
- Reduce lead times through supplier negotiation

## Gotchas

- **Seasonal products need separate treatment**: Swimsuits in January will show as "dead stock" but shouldn't be liquidated. Use seasonal adjustment or analyze by season.
- **Inventory turnover varies hugely by industry**: Grocery: 20-50x/year. Fashion: 4-6x. Electronics: 6-12x. Always benchmark within industry.
- **Low turnover ≠ bad if intentional**: Strategic inventory (buying ahead of price increases, securing supply) may justify lower turnover.
- **ABC classifications shift**: A product that was A-class last year may be C-class this year. Reclassify quarterly.
- **Carrying cost is often underestimated**: Include: warehouse rent, insurance, obsolescence, capital cost (opportunity cost of money tied up), handling labor. Total is typically 20-30% of inventory value per year.

# Real Options

## Overview

Real options theory applies financial option pricing logic to corporate investment decisions. It recognizes that managers can adapt their decisions as uncertainty resolves — deferring, expanding, contracting, or abandoning projects. Traditional NPV, which assumes a now-or-never commitment, systematically undervalues projects with significant flexibility.

## When to Use

- Evaluating investments with high uncertainty and managerial flexibility
- Comparing staged vs. committed investment strategies
- Valuing natural resource extraction, R&D, or platform investments
- When NPV is near zero but the project has strategic optionality

## When NOT to Use

- For routine, low-uncertainty investments where NPV suffices
- When flexibility is contractually or practically absent
- If the option exercise conditions are unclear or unquantifiable

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Traditional NPV undervalues projects with significant
managerial flexibility. Expanded NPV = Static NPV + Option Value.
Ignoring optionality leads to systematic underinvestment in
high-uncertainty, high-flexibility projects.
```

Key assumptions:
1. Managers can and will exercise flexibility optimally
2. Underlying asset value follows a stochastic process
3. Option exercise is feasible (legal, organizational, technical)
4. Market exists (or proxy exists) to estimate volatility

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Identify Embedded Options

| Option Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Defer | Wait for better information | Land development |
| Expand | Scale up if successful | Platform investment |
| Contract | Scale down if conditions worsen | Modular production |
| Abandon | Exit and recover salvage value | R&D project |
| Switch | Change inputs or outputs | Flex-fuel plant |

### Step 2 — Map to Option Parameters

- Underlying asset value (S): PV of project cash flows
- Exercise price (K): investment cost or salvage value
- Time to expiration (T): decision window
- Volatility (sigma): uncertainty in project value
- Risk-free rate (r): discount rate for option pricing

### Step 3 — Value the Option

Use binomial lattice or Black-Scholes analog. See `references/` for mathematical formulations.

### Step 4 — Compute Expanded NPV

Expanded NPV = Static NPV + Option Value. If expanded NPV is positive, the project merits investment or preservation of the option.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Real Options Analysis: [Project]

### Static NPV
- NPV = $X (using traditional DCF)

### Embedded Options Identified
| Option | Type | Value Driver |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [name] | [defer/expand/abandon/...] | [key uncertainty] |

### Option Valuation
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Underlying (S) | $X |
| Exercise price (K) | $X |
| Volatility | x% |
| Time (T) | X years |
| Option value | $X |

### Expanded NPV
- Static NPV + Option Value = $X
- Decision: [invest / defer / preserve option]
```

## Gotchas

- Volatility estimation for real assets is far harder than for traded securities
- Assumes optimal exercise — behavioral biases may cause premature or delayed exercise
- Option interactions matter: exercising one option may kill another (e.g., expand kills abandon)
- Real options can justify procrastination disguised as "preserving flexibility"
- Black-Scholes assumptions (continuous trading, log-normal returns) rarely hold for real assets
- Organizational capability to actually exercise options is often overestimated

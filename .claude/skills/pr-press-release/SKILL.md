# Press Release Writing

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Inverted Pyramid — Most Important First

Journalists scan, not read. The headline + first paragraph must contain
the COMPLETE story (who, what, when, where, why). Every subsequent
paragraph adds LESS important detail. If an editor cuts from the bottom,
the core message survives.
```

### Press Release Structure

**1. Headline** (< 10 words)
- Verb + Number + Value: "CloudPOS Raises NT$100M to Expand Across Southeast Asia"
- No jargon, no self-congratulation ("We're excited to announce...")

**2. Sub-headline** (optional, 1 sentence)
- Adds context the headline couldn't fit

**3. Dateline**
- City, Date — "TAIPEI, April 6, 2026 —"

**4. Lead Paragraph** (5W1H in 2-3 sentences)
- WHO did WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and HOW
- This paragraph must stand alone as the entire story

**5. Quote** (1-2 quotes)
- From CEO or relevant executive
- Must add insight, not restate the lead: "This expansion reflects our belief that..." not "We are excited to announce..."

**6. Supporting Details** (2-3 paragraphs)
- Data, context, background, market information
- Ordered by decreasing importance

**7. Boilerplate** (company description, ~50 words)
- Standard "About [Company]" paragraph used across all releases

**8. Contact Information**
- PR contact name, email, phone

### Headline Writing Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use active verbs | "Company X Launches..." | Passive voice: "New product is launched by..." |
| Include numbers | "$5M funding", "50% growth" | Vague: "significant growth" |
| Be specific | "AI Resume Tool for Healthcare" | Generic: "Innovative New Solution" |
| Front-load keywords | "[Brand] [Action] [Object]" | Bury the news: "After months of work, [Brand]..." |

### Distribution Strategy

| Channel | Reach | Cost | Best For |
|---------|-------|------|----------|
| Wire service (PR Newswire, BusinessWire) | Broad | $$$ | Major announcements, SEO |
| Direct media pitch | Targeted | Free | Specific journalists, exclusive stories |
| Company newsroom/blog | Owned | Free | SEO, reference, always available |
| Social media | Followers | Free | Amplification, engagement |
| Taiwan-specific: 中央社, 經濟日報 | Local | $-$$ | Taiwan market announcements |

### Media Pitch Email Template

## Gotchas

- **Journalists ignore 90%+ of press releases**: Make yours survive the 3-second scan test — headline + first paragraph must be compelling and newsworthy.
- **"We're excited" is not news**: Nobody cares that you're excited. What's the impact? What's the number? What's different?
- **Timing matters**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM local time gets best pickup. Avoid Friday afternoons, holidays, and days with major competing news.
- **Exclusive vs wide distribution**: Offering an exclusive to one key journalist can get better coverage than blasting to 500. Use for major announcements.
- **Taiwan media specifics**: Taiwan journalists respond well to LINE messages (not just email), appreciate Chinese-language releases (don't just translate from English), and value data/infographics that can be directly used in articles.

# Digital Ad Optimization

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Optimize for the Business Metric, Not the Ad Metric

High CTR with low conversion = wasted clicks (attracting curiosity, not buyers).
Low CPC with no sales = cheap traffic that doesn't convert.

The only metrics that matter: CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), ROAS (Return On Ad Spend),
and ultimately: profit per ad dollar. Optimize the funnel, not the ad.
```

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | Audience | Avg CPC (Taiwan) | Targeting Strength |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Google Search** | High-intent queries, direct response | Active searchers | NT$5-30 | Keyword intent (strongest) |
| **Google Display** | Awareness, retargeting, broad reach | Passive browsing | NT$1-5 | Contextual, audience |
| **Meta (FB/IG)** | Social discovery, visual products, lookalike | Social users | NT$3-15 | Interest, behavior, lookalike |
| **LINE LAP** | Taiwan-specific, broad reach | LINE users (95% Taiwan) | NT$3-20 | Demographics, interests |
| **YouTube** | Video branding, consideration | Video viewers | NT$1-5 (CPV) | Intent, affinity, in-market |
| **TikTok** | Gen Z, viral products, short-form video | Young demographic | NT$2-10 | Interest, behavior |

### Bidding Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Manual CPC** | You set max CPC | Learning phase, small budgets, full control |
| **Target CPA** | Algorithm optimizes for target cost per acquisition | 30+ conversions/month, known CPA target |
| **Target ROAS** | Algorithm optimizes for target return on ad spend | E-commerce, known revenue per conversion |
| **Maximize Conversions** | Spend full budget to get max conversions | Growth phase, less concerned about CPA |
| **Maximize Clicks** | Most clicks for budget | Traffic campaigns, awareness |

### Optimization Workflow

**Phase 1: Audit Current Performance**
- CPA by campaign, ad group, keyword/audience
- Quality Score (Google) or Relevance Score (Meta)
- Conversion rate by landing page
- Wasted spend: search terms with clicks but no conversions

**Phase 2: Quick Wins (Week 1-2)**
- Add negative keywords (Google Search)
- Pause underperforming ad groups/audiences
- Reduce bids on high-CPA keywords
- Fix landing page mismatches (ad promise ≠ landing page content)

**Phase 3: Structural Improvements (Week 3-4)**
- Audience segmentation: separate cold, warm, hot audiences
- Creative refresh: new ad copy/images (fatigue sets in after 2-4 weeks)
- Landing page optimization: speed, mobile, clear CTA

**Phase 4: Scaling (Month 2+)**
- Increase budget on winning campaigns (incrementally, +20%/week)
- Expand to new audiences (lookalikes, new interests)
- Test new platforms
- Build retargeting funnel: awareness → consideration → conversion

### Creative Testing (A/B)

| Element | What to Test | Minimum Sample |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Headline | Benefit vs feature, question vs statement | 1,000 impressions each |
| Image/Video | Product shot vs lifestyle, static vs video | 1,000 impressions each |
| CTA | "Shop Now" vs "Learn More" vs "Get Offer" | 500 clicks each |
| Offer | Free shipping vs % discount vs gift | 100 conversions each |

## Gotchas

- **Learning phase needs patience**: Google/Meta algorithms need 50+ conversions per week per ad group to optimize. Restructuring too frequently resets learning.
- **Attribution isn't perfect**: Google takes credit for Google, Meta takes credit for Meta. Use UTM parameters and a neutral analytics tool (GA4) for cross-platform attribution.
- **Creative fatigue is real**: Even winning ads degrade over 2-4 weeks as the same audience sees them repeatedly. Refresh creatives regularly.
- **Taiwan ad market specifics**: LINE LAP reaches demographics that Facebook is losing (older users). Google is dominant for search intent. Mix platforms based on your audience.
- **iOS privacy (ATT)**: Since iOS 14.5, Meta tracking is limited. Expect less accurate reporting for iOS users. Use conversion API and model-based attribution.
